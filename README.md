# 🚗 Random Forest Regressor on Used Car Price Prediction

This project implements a **Random Forest Regressor** model using a dataset of used cars to predict their prices based on various features. It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes features such as:
- Year of Purchase
- Present Price
- Selling Price
- Fuel Type
- Seller Type
- Transmission
- Owner

## 🛠️ Key Steps

- Data Cleaning and Exploration (EDA)
- Encoding Categorical Variables
- Train-Test Split
- Model Training with Random Forest Regressor
- Evaluation using R² Score and MAE/MSE/RMSE
- Prediction and Visualization

## 📈 Model Used

- **Random Forest Regressor** from `sklearn.ensemble`
- Provides high accuracy with non-linear data

## 📌 Results

- Achieved good accuracy with minimal overfitting.
- Used model performance metrics like:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
